# Omarchy Vesper Theme Port

This project is a port of the **Vesper Theme**, which I personally use in **Visual Studio Code**.

The goal of this port is to bring the same aesthetics, color scheme, and overall visual experience of the Vesper Theme to other environments where it is not natively available.
